# Nywton-
A sensor to detect medically asymptomatic concussions in athletes.

Nywton is worn by the athlete and detects medically asymptomatic concussions suffered by an athelete. It then alerts coaches on the sideline about it allowing them to get medical help for the athlete.

It is built using the Particle Photon Wifi board and programmed in C++ using the arduino IDE.
